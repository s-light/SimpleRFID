# Simple2ReadLookup

This example demonstrates how you can use `SimpleRFID2` to read the ID from a near RFID tag 
and print additional (hard-coded) information from a *lookup*

## Materials

To run this example you need these components:

-   [Arduino](https://store.arduino.cc/arduino-genuino/boards-modules)
-   [Groove RFID Reader](http://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Grove-125KHz_RFID_Reader/)
-   At least one RFID tag (chip or card)
-   Grove-Kabel
-   [Grove Shield](http://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Base_Shield_V2/)

## Setup

1. Open the example skecth by selecting `File > Examples > SimpleRFID > Simple2Read`
2. Connect the RFID-reader to your Arduino (RX to PIN2, TX to PIN3 â†’ Port Groove D2)
3. Connect your Ardunio to your PC
4. Upload the code to your Arduino
5. Open the serial monitor by selecting `Tools > Serial Monitor`

## Usage

Hold a RFID tag close to the RFID reader and look at the monitor.
The monitor should print the ID of the tag.
if the tag is *known* the `Name` and `Age` of the person is printed.
you have to edit the `person_list` so that your tag-ids are *known*.
the IDs should be printed on the physical tags. 
They are maximal 10 characters long - leading zeros are ignored.
